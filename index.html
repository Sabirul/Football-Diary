                    <p>Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina.

At the age of 8, he was recruited to join the youth system of Newell's Old Boys, a Rosario-based club.

                    <h1>Ángel Di María</h1>
                    <p>Di María was born on 14 February 1988 in Rosario, Santa Fe, as one of three children of Miguel and Diana, and grew up in Perdriel. As an infant, he was unusually active, and on recommendation of a doctor was signed up for football at age three. He also helped his parents with their work at a local coal yard along with his two sisters, Vanesa and Evelyn. Due to the low income his family earned, purchasing football boots and keeping up with Di María's hobby was difficult for his parents. He considers himself to be a "family man" and has used a significant amount of his salary to "give back" to his family. After being transferred to Benfica, he asked his father not to work anymore and purchased a house for his parents and sisters. <span class="quote">I did my best, but football is not like maths: often, a lot of things out of our control affect the way we feel and the way things turn out.->De Maria</span> </p>

Alves' father had a passion for football as well, and eventually managed to organize his own football team. Alves, at age 6, started as a winger, but because of the lack of goals he scored, his father re-positioned him as a right back, a position he still plays up to this day. Alves worked as a farmer and a trader in his youth. <span class="quote">"You have to be strong and calm to overcome difficult moments."-> Dani Alvez</span></p>
